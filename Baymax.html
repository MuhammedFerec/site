    <h1>Information about Baymax</h1>
    <p>In Big Hero 6, Baymax is voiced by Scott Adsit.
       In the film, he is depicted as an inflatable robot with a carbon fiber skeleton built by Hiro Hamada's older brother Tadashi to serve as a personal healthcare provider companion.
        Co-director Don Hall said "Baymax views the world from one perspective—he just wants to help people, he sees Hiro as his patient."
         Producer Roy Conli said "The fact that his character is a robot limits how you can emote, but Scott was hilarious.
          He took those boundaries and was able to shape the language in a way that makes you feel Baymax’s emotion and sense of humor. 
          Scott was able to relay just how much Baymax cares." The film was released under the title Baymax in Germany and Japan. 
          Baymax's design in the film drew influence from Japanese anime and Shogun Warriors toys. 
          Mecha designer Shigeto Koyama, who previously did design work for mecha anime such as Gunbuster 2, Eureka Seven,
           Gurren Lagann and Rebuild of Evangelion, worked on the concept design for Baymax in the film.
